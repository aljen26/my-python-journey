# 🐍 Learn Python

Welcome to my Python learning repository! This repo is a structured log of my journey learning Python from scratch — all the way to automation and AI/ML later.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- ⏳ Variables & Data Types
- ⏳ Control Flow (if/else, match-case)
- ⏳ Functions
- ⏳ Loops (for, while)
- ⏳ Data Structures (lists, dicts, sets, tuples)
- ⏳ Object-Oriented Programming
- ⏳ Modules & File Handling
- ⏳ Error Handling
- ⏳ Automation basics (TBD)

## 🧠 Why This Exists

I'm transitioning into Python development and automation. This repo is my way of practicing, documenting, and tracking progress — so I can review and showcase real learning over time.

## 🗂️ Structure
